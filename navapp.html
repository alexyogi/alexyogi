                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>Our project aims to help UMD students easily locate classrooms inside campus buildings by creating a navigation app that includes detailed interior building layouts—something most existing tools don’t offer. Since many students struggle to find rooms and arrive on time, our target users are UMD students who need a reliable, intuitive, and widely used tool to guide them between locations. We plan to evaluate success by testing whether students who previously had difficulty navigating campus improve their speed and punctuality when using the app. Over the coming weeks, we will move through ideation, user-flow mapping, and case-study analysis to shape our design and better understand the student journey. The final outcome will be an accurate and user-friendly mobile or web platform prototype that helps students quickly and confidently find their classrooms.</p>

            <div class="problem fade-in">
                <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
                <p>UMD has a large, widely spread-out campus with countless academic buildings, lecture halls, and hidden classroom wings that can be difficult to navigate, especially for newer students or those visiting a building for the first time. At the beginning of each semester, many students find themselves wandering through hallways, checking floor maps, or retracing their steps while trying to locate the correct room number. This confusion can easily lead to arriving late to class, missing important material, and experiencing unnecessary stress or anxiety before the day has even begun.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="process fade-in">
                <h1>Process</h1>
                <p>To tackle the navigation challenges faced by UMD students, we began by conducting user research through interviews and surveys to gather insights on their experiences and pain points when finding classrooms. We then created user personas and journey maps to better understand the typical student experience. Based on this research, we brainstormed features that would enhance usability, such as detailed indoor maps, step-by-step directions, and accessibility options. We developed wireframes and interactive prototypes using design tools like Figma, focusing on intuitive navigation and a clean interface. Usability testing sessions were conducted with a group of students to gather feedback, which we used to refine the design iteratively. Finally, we compiled our findings and design solutions into a comprehensive case study that highlights the app's potential impact on improving campus navigation for students.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Our research and persona development shaped the user flow by revealing challenges students like Andrew face—such as relying on screenshots and unclear signage. To address this, we designed a simple, digital navigation experience with quick access to class info and step-by-step directions. Andrew’s need for punctuality and clarity guided key design choices, resulting in an intuitive interface that reduces stress and supports student success.</p>

                </div>
                <p>This user journey map illustrates how UMD students discover, evaluate, and adopt a classroom navigation app across five key phases: Consider, Explore, Compare, Test, and Negotiate. It captures students’ thoughts, motivations, and behaviors at each stage, from first hearing about the app through friends or flyers, to researching alternatives, comparing features, testing the app in real classroom settings, and ultimately deciding whether to commit to using it. The map also highlights key pain points such as confusion navigating unfamiliar buildings, uncertainty about which app to trust, and the desire for reliable, intuitive tools. This journey was developed using real student feedback, personas, and research insights to authentically reflect the needs, frustrations, and decision-making process of UMD students navigating campus life.</p>

                <h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
                <p>The proposed solution is a mobile and web-based application that helps UMD students quickly find their classrooms inside campus buildings. It features detailed interior maps, a simple user interface, and step-by-step directions to specific rooms based on the student’s schedule. The goal is to reduce confusion, save time, and improve punctuality by providing clear, reliable navigation within buildings.</p>
                <p>Building on our understanding of the problem, we turned to research to validate our assumptions and better understand student needs. By gathering insights from real user experiences, we aimed to design a solution that directly addresses their challenges.</p>
                <ul class="research-details">
                    <li>Despite a decade-old update aimed at improving campus navigation, UMD students still struggle to find their classrooms—especially within complex building layouts.

                <p>This represents the first iteration of our high-fidelity prototype, which we designed in Figma. Shown here are the three primary landing pages that form the core experience of the app. This early prototype allowed us to translate our ideas into a realistic interface and evaluate how users might navigate through the product. The insights gained from this version directly informed the next iteration of the high-fidelity prototype, where I refined the layout, improved the visual hierarchy, and created a cleaner, more cohesive user interface overall.</p>

                </div>
                <p>After gathering feedback from usability testing on our initial high-fidelity prototype, I made several key improvements to enhance the user experience. I refined the layout to create a cleaner, more intuitive interface that reduces cognitive load. The visual hierarchy was improved by adjusting font sizes, colors, and spacing to guide users' attention to the most important elements. Additionally, I standardized design elements such as buttons and icons to ensure consistency throughout the app. These changes aimed to make navigation smoother and more efficient, ultimately resulting in a polished final prototype that better meets the needs of UMD students seeking classroom navigation assistance.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Going further in depth, these screens show the high-fidelity prototype of the app’s mapping and classroom navigation features. Students can search for a building or classroom directly within the map interface and instantly view relevant results, including location details and classroom identifiers. Once a destination is selected, the app provides walking directions, estimated travel time, and an arrival estimate to help students plan more efficiently. For classroom-level navigation, users can also view an interior floor plan that highlights the exact room location within the building. Together, these features are designed to reduce confusion, streamline wayfinding, and help students confidently navigate campus spaces.</p>

                <p>This project aimed to improve campus navigation for UMD students by designing an intuitive app that simplifies the process of finding classrooms. Through user research, persona development, and iterative design, we created a prototype that addresses real student pain points—offering clear directions, quick access to schedules, and a user-friendly interface.</p>
                <p>Moving forward, we plan to conduct further usability testing to refine the prototype and begin development of a working beta version. We’ll also explore integration with existing campus systems and consider partnerships with the university to support a full-scale rollout.</p>
