                <h1>Design Justification</h1>
                <p>The mission will utilize a data extraction arm controlled by a single servo motor which will be able to raise and lower the arm into and out of the pylon. The arm will be 3D-printed from PLA plastic and will be attached inside of a 3D-printed vertical rail. The back of the arm will interact with a gear and form a rack-and-pinion system (also made of PLA plastic) that will allow for vertical translation of the arm. The rail will be permanently fixed to the chassis using fasteners which will prevent unnecessary arm motion.</p>
                <p>The arm will be placed on the front of the OTV with the arm reaching out over the triangular cutout in the chassis. The arm rails will be placed at the base of the cutout. The mission will be carried out by using a number of data collection sensors. A hall magnetic sensor will be used to determine the magnetism of the puck at the base of the pylon. Copper wiring will be attached to the inside of the arm to contact the data outputs. The wire will transmit the voltage output of the signal and will measure voltage through the Arduino microcontroller. This voltage will be recorded over a given time period and averaged in order to calculate duty cycle. This data can be wirelessly transmitted with a WIFI module to the ENES lab computer.</p>

                <h1>Chassis Design</h1>
                <p>I was on the chassis subteam, focusing on the design and prototyping of the vehicle chassis. The chassis needs to provide space for electronics that will be connected to arm and wheels, as well as arduino mount. The design includes four extensions to house four motors to enable four wheel drive. The trapezoidal cutout serves to guide the pylon to the right place and gives the arm space to lower for data extraction. Additionally, the size and shape allow the chassis to balance the weight of the arm and prevent any tipping.</p>

                        <p>This is a CAD rendering for the final design. After starting the prototyping process, we encountered some issues and decided to tweak the original design. We noticed that we needed to add an extra cutout to the triangle in order to allow the extraction arm to operate properly. Additionally, we added railing structures to either side to provide more space for electronics on the chassis. We moved the aruco marker onto a custom cut acrylic sheet, which went on top of the railings. It also helped managed all the wires above the chassis, preventing it from accidentally getting caught or snagged on surrounding objects.</p>

                        <p>In addition to the unique data extraction mission that our OTV has to execute, it has to complete an obstacle course that includes either going over a hump or under a beam. The data extraction arm already made the vehicle a little tall, so we decided to go over the hump because the vehicle could complete it more confidently. In order to accomodate this, we chose to design our OTV with large, all-terrain tires, giving the vehicle a large ground clearance and the ability to easily traverse the obstable. We ordered these wheels on Amazon.</p>

            <p>During assembly, we discovered that the motor fit loosely within the initial motor mount once the physical motors arrived. The opening diameter and contact surfaces were adjusted to reduce excess clearance and improve alignment, ensuring the motor remained securely supported during mission. This process emphasized the importance of validating CAD assumptions against real components and accounting for manufacturing tolerances to achieve a reliable final design.</p>

                <p>During preliminary testing, the vehicle performed as intended and demonstrated reliable mobility, steering, and overall system functionality. However, on the final performance assessment day, an issue arose with one of the front wheels that prevented the vehicle from turning correctly. As a result, the OTV was unable to properly adjust its heading and did not reach the pylon as intended during the mission. The wheel continued to experience intermittent issues throughout the assessment, which ultimately prevented the vehicle from completing the entire mission successfully. Despite this setback, the test highlighted the importance of mechanical robustness and real-time reliability under mission conditions.</p>
